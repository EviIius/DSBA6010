# **Please submit three documents:** your 
- 1) model notebook and 
- 2) model documentation and -
- 3) a "flaws" document

## In this assignment your group will Lending Club data to create a predictive model and, as a rogue actor, plant 2 problems into your code that make your model unsound or unfit in some way.  You must also place 1 problem in your model documentation (not in the Risk Management section -- see notes below)

## The model notebook and model documentation must not give-away your flaws--they should be hidden!  Your flaws should be described in the "flaws" document only.

## You must take the starter notebook Download starter notebookand add to it for your model training and testing. The data is from Lending Club and each row is a loan.  You should not include data outside of the data set in the starter notebook.  There is a data dictionary Download data dictionaryfor the columns and a list of columns that are only available after a loan is made Download list of columns that are only available after a loan is made(the data includes both loan application data and loan performance data). 

## Your model documentation must contain these sections:

- Statement of Purpose (for the model)
- Foundational Data
- the data used for training / testing
- any filtering / subsetting of the data
- data splitting
- Features & Feature Engineering
- a description of the data used as predictors
- handling missing values
- any transformations
- Models
- Describe the two models that were built
- Describe and compare the performance of the two models
- Select the "winning" model and reasoning
- Interpretability / Explainability
- Show feature importance
- Show partial dependence plots for each feature
- Risk Management
- State any known weaknesses / risks of your winning model
- Suggest controls for the model
- You must place 1 flaw in your model documentation (do not put your flaw in the Risk Management section).
